''' This program is the starter code for the student management system that we are building a GUI for
 It should be used for each new task. 
 It has class definitions and generates all students and teachers, otherwise has no functionality.
 You will need to have this saved in the same folder as the teachers.csv and myRandomStudents.csv files.
